This repository is my personal library of useful snippets, code
examples, and programs I have built over the years in various
programming languages.

Motivation
==========

[Coding cookbooks](https://github.com/DevDungeon/Cookbook) are my
preferred way of learning new programming languages, libraries, and
frameworks.

> A cookbook in the programming context is collection of tiny programs
> that each demonstrate a particular programming concept. The Cookbook
> Method is the process of learning a programming language by building
> up a repository of small programs that implement specific programming
> concepts.

I frequently use this repository for quick reference and as building
blocks for bigger projects.
