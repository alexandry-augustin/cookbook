With the release of Alpine `3.x`, Spruce has been replaced with a first-party `$store` helper, as well as `Alpine.store`. 
This package will continue to support Alpine `2.x`, but only with security releases. 
I want thank everyone who has used and supported this packages development over the last couple of years, it really does mean a lot. ❤️
