Before Tailwind CSS, developers relied on traditional libraries like Bootstrap and YUI to speed up website and web application styling during development. However, these libraries offered default styles that were difficult to override and customize.

As a result, many websites built with these tools ended up looking similar, lacking uniqueness and brand identity. This lack of flexibility encouraged developers to seek alternatives that provided more granular control over website appearance.

While Tailwind gave developers the flexibility to create custom designs, the use of utility classes sometimes led to lengthy and repetitive markup. Styling even simple elements required multiple class names, resulting in larger HTML files. Developers needed a way to balance customization with maintainability.

Pouya Saadeghi, a software engineer from Turkey, created daisyUI with the goal of balancing two common developer concerns: maintainability and customizability. Tailwind CSS offered improved customizability over traditional UI libraries, but had limited reusability and generated excessive code, which made maintaining projects challenging.

combine[s] the best of both worlds: the efficiency of utility classes and the reusability of components.

module.exports = {
  //...

  // add daisyUI plugin
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],

  // daisyUI config (optional - here are the default values)
  daisyui: {
    themes: false, // false: only light + dark | true: all themes | array: specific themes like this ["light", "dark", "cupcake"]
    darkTheme: "dark", // name of one of the included themes for dark mode

`styled`:: Boolean (default: true) If it's true, components will have colors and style so you won't need to design anything. If it's false, components will have no color and no visual style so you can design your own style on a basic skeleton.
