> "All HTML elements can be considered "boxes", this includes `div` tag, `p` tag, or `a` tag. Each of those boxes has five modifiable dimensions:

> - the `height` and `width` describe dimensions of the actual content of the box (text, images, ...)
>   - the `padding` describes the space between this content and the border of the box
>    - the `border` is any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed...) surrounding the box, if present
>    - the `margin` is the space around the border" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_box_model

> "Margin is unique in that it doesn't affect the size of the box itself per se, but it affects other content interacting with the box" -- https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/

The size of the box itself is calculated like this:
Width: `width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right`
Height: `height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom`

== `border`

The border property is a shorthand property for:

- `border-width`
- `border-style` (required)
- `border-color`

Example:

[source,css]
----
border-bottom: 1px solid #a31d1d;

border-bottom-width: 1px;
border-bottom-style: solid;
border-bottom-color: #a31d1d;

== `box-sizing`

[source,css]
----
.module
{
  box-sizing: border-box;    
}
----

- `content-box` (default): the default. Width and height values apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the  outside of the box.
- `padding-box`: Width and height values apply to the  element's content and its padding. The border is added to the outside of the box. Currently, only Firefox supports the `padding-box` value.
- `border-box`: Width and height values apply to the content, padding, and border.
- `inherit`: inherits the box sizing of the parent element.

> "Let's say you set an element to `width: 100px; padding: 20px; border: 5px solid black;`. By default, the resulting box is 150px wide. That's because the default box sizing model is `content-box`, which applies an element's declared width to its content only, placing  the padding and border outside the element's box. This effectively  increases how much space the element takes up. 
>
> If you change the `box-sizing` to `padding-box`, the padding is pushed inside the element's box. Then, the box would be  110px wide, with 20px of padding on the inside and 10px of border on the outside. If you want to put the padding *and* the border inside the box, you can use `border-box`. The box would then be 100px wide â€” the 10px of border and 20px of padding are both pushed inside the element's box." -- https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-sizing/
