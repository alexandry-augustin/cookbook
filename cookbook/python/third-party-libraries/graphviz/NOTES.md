# Installation

```bash
conda install graphviz python-graphviz
pip install graphviz
```

NOTE: 

> " `conda install graphviz` does not do the same thing as `pip install graphviz`.  `conda install python-graphviz` does.  `conda install graphviz` installs the binaries, which is the same as downloading and installing GraphViz from their website." -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33433274/anaconda-graphviz-cant-import-after-installation
