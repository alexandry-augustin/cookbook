	is actually opening the file for writing using the ascii codec implicitly. If you want to specify another codec, you need to either use the encoding parameter of the open function in Python 3.x:
	
	out_file = open('example.txt', 'a', 'utf-8')
	or if you are still using Python 2.x (the latest is Python 2.7.3 at the time of this writing), you need to use the functions from the codecs module:
	
	out_file = codecs.open('example.txt', 'a', 'utf-8')
	since open in Python 2.x doesn't allow you to specify an encoding (you can use it to read the byte stream into a byte string in memory though, and then decode that string).
