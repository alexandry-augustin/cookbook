Which one should you use?

For most projects, especially new ones:: *MyPy* is generally the safest and most widely adopted choice. It has excellent documentation, a large community, and integrates well into almost any Python workflow.
If you're primarily a VS Code user:: *Pyright/Pylance* is probably already providing you with excellent real-time type checking in your editor.
For very large monorepos or specific performance needs:: *Pyre* (or its successor Pyrefly) might be a good fit, particularly if you have a strong engineering team to support its integration.
For legacy codebases with minimal annotations:: *Pytype* can be very helpful for getting initial type coverage.

Many teams also combine these tools. For example, they might use Pylance for immediate feedback in the IDE and run MyPy in their CI/CD pipeline for a more rigorous, complete check.
