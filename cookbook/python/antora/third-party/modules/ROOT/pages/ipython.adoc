As of IPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts of the project: the notebook format, message protocol, qtconsole, notebook web application, etc. have moved to new projects under the name Jupyter. 
IPython itself is focused on interactive Python, part of which is providing a Python kernel for Jupyter.

IPython is not part of Project Jupyter, but it is a foundational component and the original project from which Jupyter evolved.

Here's the breakdown of their relationship:

* **The Origin:** **IPython** (Interactive Python) started first as a powerful, enhanced Python interactive shell.
* **The Split:** In 2014, the parts of IPython that dealt with the notebook interface, messaging protocol, and other language-agnostic features were spun off into a new project called **Project Jupyter**. The name "Jupyter" is a nod to the three initial core languages: **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R**.
* **The Current Role of IPython:** Today, the IPython project is focused on being the **interactive Python shell** and providing the **Python kernel** for the Jupyter ecosystem. The *kernel* is the program that executes the code you type in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

So, while the core **Jupyter Notebook** and **JupyterLab** applications are part of the Jupyter project, they use the **IPython kernel** to run Python code. IPython is a key piece of the puzzle, but it maintains its own focus on interactive Python features.
