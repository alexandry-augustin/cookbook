= `uuid`

[,Gemini]
____
The `uuid` module supports several versions of UUIDs, each with a different method of generation:

`uuid.uuid1()`:: Generates a UUID based on the host's MAC address and the current time. This is a very common way to generate UUIDs but can be a privacy concern since it uses the MAC address.
`uuid.uuid4()`:: Generates a random UUID. This is the most common and recommended method for general use cases since it doesn't leak any identifiable information.
`uuid.uuid3()` and `uuid.uuid5()`:: These generate UUIDs from the hash of a namespace identifier and a name. They are "deterministic," meaning the same namespace and name will always produce the same UUID. This is useful for creating a consistent UUID for a given resource.

== Short UUID

[,Gemini]
____
Short UUID a used to generate a short, URL-friendly UUID that is typically around 22 characters long, which is significantly shorter than the standard 36-character UUID.

____
`str(uuid.uuid4())` is 36 chars but it has four useless dashes (`-`) in it, and it's limited to `0-9` `a-f`.

Better uuid4 in 32 chars:

[,python]
----
uuid.uuid4().hex
----

....
'b327fc1b6a2343e48af311343fc3f5a8'
....

Or just `b64` encode and slice some urandom bytes (up to you to guarantee uniqueness):

[,python]
----
base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32))[:8]
----

....
b'iR4hZqs9'
