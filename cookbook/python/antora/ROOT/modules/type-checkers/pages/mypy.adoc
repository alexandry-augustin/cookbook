= MyPy

____
The King of Type Checkers:: MyPy is by far the most widely used and influential static type checker for Python. It was one of the first to fully implement PEP 484 (the standard for type hints) and has a strong community backing.
Features:: It performs comprehensive static analysis, catching type errors in functions, variables, and complex data structures. It's highly configurable and supports gradual typing, allowing you to add type hints to your codebase incrementally.
Integration:: MyPy can be run as a command-line tool, integrated into CI/CD pipelines, and many IDEs (though some might use Pyright for their built-in checks).
Considerations:: While powerful, MyPy can sometimes be slower on very large codebases, and its error messages can be verbose for newcomers.
