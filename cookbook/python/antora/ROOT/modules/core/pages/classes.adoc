== Old-style (Classic) Class

Up to Python `2.1`

[source,python]
----
class OldStyleClass():
    pass
----

== New-style Class

Introduced in Python `2.2`

New-style classes inherit from `object`

[source,python]
----
class NewStyleClass(object):
    pass
----

Python `3` doesn't support old style classes

"No matter if you subclass from `object` or not, classes are new-style in Python `3`."
