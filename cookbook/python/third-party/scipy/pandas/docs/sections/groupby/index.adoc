There are two major differences between the `transform()` and `apply()` of the `groupby()` methods.

* `apply()` implicitly passes all the columns for each group as a `DataFrame` to the custom function, while `transform()` passes each column for each group as a `Series` to the custom function
* The custom function passed to `apply()` can return a scalar, or a `Series` or `DataFrame` (or numpy array or even list). 
The custom function passed to `transform` must return a sequence (a one dimensional `Series`, `array` or `list`) the same length as the group.

So, `transform()` works on just one `Series` at a time and `apply()` works on the entire `DataFrame` at once.

So, `transform()` is only allowed to work with a single `Series` at a time. 
It is impossible for it to act on two columns at the same time. 

`count`:: Number of non-null observations
`sum`:: Sum of values
`mean`:: Mean of values
`mad`:: Mean absolute deviation
`median`:: Arithmetic median of values
`min`:: Minimum
`max`:: Maximum
`mode`:: Mode
`abs`:: Absolute Value
`prod`:: Product of values
`std`:: Unbiased standard deviation
`var`:: Unbiased variance
`sem`:: Unbiased standard error of the mean
`skew`:: Unbiased skewness (3rd moment)
`kurt`:: Unbiased kurtosis (4th moment)
`quantile`:: Sample quantile (value at %)
`cumsum`:: Cumulative sum
`cumprod`:: Cumulative product
`cummax`:: Cumulative maximum
`cummin`:: Cumulative minimum
