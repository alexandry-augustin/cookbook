____
You can have Python or Shell scripts that run before and/or after your project is generated. Create a hooks folder at the top level of your template project and create a new Python file.

____
When the hook scripts script are run, their current working directory is the root of the generated project [i.e. `/[...]/{{cookiecutter.directory_name}}/`]. 
This makes it easy for a post-generate hook to find generated files using relative paths.

____
If a hook script fails (that is, if it finishes with a nonzero exit status), the project generation will stop and the generated directory will be cleaned up.
