// The simple_state class template accepts up to four parameters:
// - The third parameter specifies the inner initial state, if
//   there is one. Here, only Active has inner states, which is
//   why it needs to pass its inner initial state Stopped to its
//   base
// - The fourth parameter specifies whether and what kind of
//   history is kept

// Active is the outermost state and therefore needs to pass the
// state machine class it belongs to
struct Active : sc::simple_state<Active, StopWatch, Stopped > {};

// Stopped and Running both specify Active as their Context,
// which makes them nested inside Active
struct Running : sc::simple_state< Running, Active > {};
struct Stopped : sc::simple_state< Stopped, Active > {};

// Because the context of a state must be a complete type (i.e.
// not forward declared), a machine must be defined from
// "outside to inside". That is, we always start with the state
// machine, followed by outermost states, followed by the direct
// inner states of outermost states and so on. We can do so in a
// breadth-first or depth-first way or employ a mixture of the
// two.
