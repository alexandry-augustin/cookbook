== Document Object Model (DOM)

____
"When you create a script [...] you can immediately begin using the API for the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document[`document`] or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window[`window`] elements to manipulate the document itself or to get at the children of that document, which are the various elements in the web page." -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction

=== Aliases

`window`: `window`

`document`: `window.document`

=== `window`

=== `document`

"the `window` object represents something like the browser, and the `document` object is the root of the document itself. `Element` inherits from the generic `Node` interface, and together these two interfaces provide many of the  methods and properties you use on individual elements. These elements  may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data  those elements hold, as in the `table` object example in the previous section." -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction

| Data type (Interface) | Description

| https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document[`Document`]
| When a member returns an object of type `document` (e.g., the `ownerDocument` property of an element returns the `document` to which it belongs), this object is the root `document` object itself.

| https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node[`Node`]
| Every object located within a document is a node of some kind. In an HTML document, an object can be an element node but also a text node or attribute node.

| https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element[`Element`]
| The `element` type is based on `node`. It refers to an element or a node of type `element` returned by a member of the DOM API. Rather than saying, for example, that the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement[`document.createElement()`] method returns an object reference to a `node`, we just say that this method returns the `element` that has just been created in the DOM. `element` objects implement the DOM `Element` interface and also the more basic `Node` interface, both of which are included together in this reference. In an HTML document, elements are further enhanced by the HTML DOM API's https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement[`HTMLElement`] interface as well as other interfaces describing capabilities of specific kinds of elements (for instance, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableElement[`HTMLTableElement`] for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table[``] elements).

| https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList[`NodeList`]
| A `nodeList` is an array of elements, like the kind that is returned by the method https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll[`document.querySelectorAll()`]. Items in a `nodeList` are accessed by index in either of two ways:         list.item(1)     list[1]        These two are equivalent. In the first, `item()` is the single method on the `nodeList` object. The latter uses the typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list.

| `Attribute`
| When an `attribute` is returned by a member (e.g., by the `createAttribute()` method), it is an object reference that exposes a special (albeit  small) interface for attributes. Attributes are nodes in the DOM just  like elements are, though you may rarely use them as such.

| https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NamedNodeMap[`NamedNodeMap`]
| A `namedNodeMap` is like an array, but the items are  accessed by name or index, though this latter case is merely a  convenience for enumeration, as they are in no particular order in the  list. A `namedNodeMap` has an `item()` method for this purpose, and you can also add and remove items from a `namedNodeMap`.
