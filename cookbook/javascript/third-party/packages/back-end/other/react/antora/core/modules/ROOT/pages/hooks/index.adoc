____
React applications are built from components. 
Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom.

Key Syntactic Characteristics:

* It is a JavaScript function.
* Must start with the prefix use (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMyCustomHook`). 
This is a convention that allows React to enforce the "Rules of Hooks" (e.g., call them only at the top level of a functional component or another custom Hook, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
* Called directly inside functional components (or other custom Hooks).
* Does not return JSX. Instead, built-in Hooks typically return an array (like `useState`) or a value (like `useContext`), or nothing (like `useEffect`). 
Custom Hooks can return whatever data or functions are useful.
* Relies on the order of calls. 
React associates state and effects with the component based on the order in which Hooks are called.
