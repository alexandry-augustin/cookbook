= Migration from Vue

> "[In Vue] you don’t have to worry about memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders (at least not for the same reasons as in React), but you also have to adjust your mindset to a different kind of workflow. Instead of defining what code shouldn’t be executed upon which re-render, you’ll be deciding what code should be executed upon which state property update."

> "In Vue, one almost never has to think about side effects and over-rendering or optimizations requiring useMemo and useCallback because [...] the fundamental difference between Vue and React is that they have inverted models of what gets (re-) rendered."

the render cycle of React is *exceedingly dumb*. It literally steamrolls everything and wipes it out and you, as a dev, need to carefully move your stuff out of the way of React [using `useMemo` and `useCallback`]. [...] 

It's amazing that looking at the docs on useMemo and useCallback, they are kind of treated as some advanced optimization rather than "If you don't do this, you're going to have a bad time". I've not been on a React project where some dev hasn't inevitably made this mistake.

So I think I finally figured out why Vue feels more intuitive and pleasant to work with -- for me at least -- because I don't need to constantly think about moving my state out of the way lest it gets steamrolled.

The right way to think of it is that React is a very, very dumb framework. Every cycle, it wipes everything out and rebuilds it. `useMemo` and `useCallback` effectively pull the variables and functions out of the way of the React wrecking ball and put it back in on the next render.

> "`useMemo` is essentially what computed is in Vue. You should be able to replace `useMemo` with an inline computation without breaking your app. Same as in Vue you can replace computed with a method call. This is why `useMemo` is called a performance optimization."
