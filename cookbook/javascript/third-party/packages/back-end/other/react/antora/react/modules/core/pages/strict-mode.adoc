= Strict Mode

React components often render twice in development mode due to the **Strict Mode** feature. This intentional behavior helps identify and fix potential side effects in your code, which can cause bugs.

*How Strict Mode Works*

**Strict Mode** is a tool that highlights potential problems in an application. It doesn't render any visible UI but activates extra checks and warnings for its descendants. One of these checks involves intentionally double-invoking certain functions, including the component's render function.

The primary purpose of double rendering is to detect **unintentional side effects** in your component's constructor, render method, or state updaters. A side effect is any operation that affects the outside world, like:

* Modifying a variable outside the function's scope
* Making an API call
* Setting up subscriptions

By running the component's render function twice, React can see if the output is consistent. If a side effect is present (e.g., an API call is made twice, or a state variable is unexpectedly mutated), it becomes easier to spot because the "double-fire" effect makes it more noticeable.

*Why This is a Good Thing*

While it may seem inefficient, double-rendering in development mode is a powerful debugging tool. It helps you ensure your components are **pure**, meaning they will produce the same output given the same inputs without any side effects. This is a core principle of functional programming and makes your components more predictable and easier to test.

It's important to remember that this behavior **only happens in development mode**. In a production build, Strict Mode is disabled, and components will render only once, as expected. This ensures that the performance of your deployed application is not affected.
