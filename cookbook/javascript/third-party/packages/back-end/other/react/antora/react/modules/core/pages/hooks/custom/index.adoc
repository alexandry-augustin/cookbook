____
A React Hook is a special type of function that allows you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

____
a custom hook is essentially a normal JavaScript function that, internally, calls one or more built-in React Hooks. [...]
only React function components and custom hooks are allowed to call built-in Hooks [...] A regular JavaScript function that doesn't start with `use` and isn't a React component will throw an error if you try to call a built-in Hook inside it. 
This is due to the "Rules of Hooks" that React enforces.

____
Unlike React components, custom hooks do not return JSX. Their purpose is to provide state, functions, or derived values that a component can then use to render JSX.

____
A custom hook is a normal JavaScript function with two special characteristics:

* Its name must start with `use`.
* It may call other built-in (or other custom) React Hooks.
* [It does not return JSX].

____
The prefix "use" for custom hooks in React is primarily a convention, but it's a very strong one that is enforced by accompanying tooling (ESLint plugin) and is crucial for React's internal mechanisms to work correctly.
____

____
The `use` prefix is not just a suggestion; it's a critical convention. It signals to React's linter and runtime that this function is a Hook and therefore must follow the Rules of Hooks. This allows React to ensure that Hooks are called consistently and predictably, enabling its internal state management mechanism to work correctly.

____
React Hooks can only be used within functional components, whereas JavaScript functions can be used anywhere in your code.

Hooks may return arbitrary values.

Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!

____
Functions that don’t call Hooks don’t need to be Hooks.

If your function doesn’t call any Hooks, avoid the `use` prefix.

____
You should give `use` prefix to a function (and thus make it a Hook) if it uses at least one Hook inside of it [...]

Technically, this isn’t enforced by React.

Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself
