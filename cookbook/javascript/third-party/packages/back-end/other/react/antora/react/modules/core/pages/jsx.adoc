= JSX / TSX

https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html[[docs\]]

Babel transpiles JSX into regular javascript.

Use `return` with parenthesis to spread the code on multiple lines: 

[,jsx,title='fragment']
----
return (
  <>
      {/* ... */}
  </>
)
----

== Fragment

[,jsx,title='fragment']
----
<Fragment>
    {/* This is a fragment */}
</Fragment>
----

or 

[,jsx,title='fragment']
----
<>
    {/* This is a fragment */}
</>
----

== `React.createElement()`

[,https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html]
____
JSX is not a requirement for using React. 
Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you donâ€™t want to set up compilation in your build environment.

Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`. 
So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.

For example, this code written with JSX:

----
return <div>Hello {this.props.toWhat}</div>;
----

can be compiled to this code that does not use JSX:

----
return React.createElement('div', null, `Hello ${this.props.toWhat}`);
----

\[...]

The component can either be provided as a string, as a subclass of `React.Component`, or a plain function.

If you get tired of typing `React.createElement` so much, one common pattern is to assign a shorthand:

----
const h = React.createElement;

h('div', null, 'Hello World');
