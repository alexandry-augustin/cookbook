The App Router, based on the` app/` directory, allows developers to create better page layouts, handle parallel rendering, and seamlessly integrate with React 18 features such as Suspense and Streaming.

This new approach is much more scalable than the legacy pages/ directory and is optimized for both client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR).

Each folder represents a new route, and the `page.js` file within the folder serves as the content for that route.

The App Router uses the app/ directory to handle routing, layouts, error pages, and more. Here’s the key structure of the app/ directory:

`app/layout.js`:: Shared layout across all routes.
`app/page.js`:: Main page file for a route.
`app/loading.js`:: Displays a loading indicator while fetching data.
`app/error.js`:: Custom error handling for routes.

        <footer>Footer</footer>
      </div>

This layout would be applied to all the pages under the directory where it’s placed, ensuring consistent structure and reducing repetition.
