React Hook Form is a library designed for performance and simplicity. It leverages React Hooks to provide a minimal API for form management, focusing on uncontrolled components to reduce re-renders and improve speed. Its main differential is its excellent performance, simple API, and great integration with UI libraries.

I remember the first day when I release the library. 
It was exciting and full of joy. 
React hook form is getting "old", for almost 4 years now. 
It's awesome to see more form libraries compete and improve the ecosystem. ❤️
