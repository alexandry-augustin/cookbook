The most popular and feature-rich library for handling multiple image uploads with previews in React is **React-Dropzone**. 
It's a widely used library that provides a simple and flexible API for building custom drag-and-drop file upload components.

*Why use React-Dropzone?*

React-Dropzone isn't a pre-styled component, but rather a "headless" hook (`useDropzone`) that gives you the core functionality for drag-and-drop file handling. This gives you the freedom to build a completely custom UI to match your application's design.

Here's why it's a top choice:

Drag-and-Drop functionality:: It handles all the browser events for you, making it easy to create a drag-and-drop zone.
Previews:: The `onDrop` callback provides an array of file objects. You can use the `URL.createObjectURL()` method on these files to create a temporary URL for displaying previews, which is a common and recommended approach. The library's documentation even provides a clear example of this.
Multiple File Uploads:: It's specifically designed to handle single or multiple file uploads, and you can easily configure this behavior with a prop.
File Filtering:: You can restrict accepted file types (e.g., `image/*` to only accept images) and set size limits.
Customization:: Since it's a hook, you get complete control over the UI, allowing you to use your own CSS, styled-components, or a UI library like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI to style the component and the previews.

*How it works*

The core concept is simple: you use the `useDropzone` hook, which returns a set of props and functions. 
You apply these to your JSX elements.

`getRootProps()`:: You spread these props on the main container of your dropzone. This enables the drag-and-drop behavior.
`getInputProps()`:: You spread these props on a hidden file input element. This allows users to click the dropzone to open the file selection dialog.
`onDrop` callback:: This is the most important part. The `useDropzone` hook provides a callback (`onDrop`) that is triggered when files are dropped or selected. Inside this callback, you receive an array of accepted files. You then use `URL.createObjectURL()` to generate a preview URL for each file and save it in your component's state to display them.

You would also need a `useEffect` hook to clean up the temporary URLs created by `URL.createObjectURL()` to prevent memory leaks, which is also a common practice and is often included in the library's examples.
