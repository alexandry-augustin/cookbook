[NOTE]
====
Return `null` to prevent the component from rendering.

____
In practice, returning `null` from a component isn't common because it might surprise a developer trying to render it. 
More often, you would conditionally include or exclude the component in the parent component's JSX.

____
React considers `false` as a "hole" in the JSX tree, just like `null` or `undefined`, and doesn't render anything in its place.
