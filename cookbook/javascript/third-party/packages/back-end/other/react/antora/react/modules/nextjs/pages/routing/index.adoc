App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router. 
The App Router is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming. 
The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.
