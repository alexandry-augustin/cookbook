Stands for "Function Component"

The question of whether to use `React.FC` (or `React.FunctionComponent`) has been a subject of debate in the React and TypeScript community for years. The landscape has changed significantly with recent updates, so the "why" depends on the historical context and the current state of things.

*The Original Rationale for `React.FC`*

In the past, `React.FC` was the recommended way to type functional components for several reasons:

. *Implicit `children` Prop:* This was a key "feature" of `React.FC`. It automatically included a `children?: React.ReactNode` prop in the component's type definition. This was seen as a convenience, as most components can technically accept children, even if they don't explicitly use them.
. *Explicit Return Type:* `React.FC` enforces that your component must return a valid React node (e.g., a JSX element, `null`, `string`, `number`, or `undefined`). This helps catch bugs where a component might accidentally return something that isn't renderable.
. *Support for Static Properties:* `React.FC` provides type-checking for static properties on the component itself, such as `displayName` and `defaultProps`. While `defaultProps` is less common now with modern ES6 syntax, `displayName` is still used in some dev tools and is well-supported by `React.FC`.

*The Backlash and The Case Against `React.FC`*

Over time, developers realized that the "benefits" of `React.FC` came with some significant drawbacks, leading many to consider it an anti-pattern.

. *The "Implicit ``children``" Problem:* This was the biggest criticism. For components that were never intended to receive children (e.g., a self-closing `<Button />`), using `React.FC` meant that you could still pass children to it, and TypeScript wouldn't throw an error. This went against the philosophy of TypeScript, which is to be as explicit and type-safe as possible.
. *Poor `defaultProps` Support:* There were known issues with how `React.FC` interacted with `defaultProps`, leading to complex and non-intuitive type definitions.
. *Generics Issues:* Applying generics (e.g., to create a truly generic component) was difficult or impossible when using `React.FC`.

*The Current State (React 18+ & TypeScript 5.1+)*

The React and TypeScript teams listened to the community feedback. The major issues with `React.FC` have now been addressed:

* *`children` is no longer implicit:* The `React.FC` type in newer versions of React (v18+) and TypeScript (v5.1+) *no longer automatically includes the `children` prop*. If your component needs to accept children, you must explicitly define it in your props interface. This eliminates the main reason developers avoided it.
* *Improved Return Type:* `React.FC` now correctly supports returning `undefined`, `string`, and `number`, making it more aligned with valid React return values.

*So, Why Use `React.FC` Now?*

With the major drawbacks gone, the decision to use `React.FC` is largely a matter of *personal or team preference and coding style*.

The main arguments for using it today are:

* *Explicitness:* It makes it immediately clear that the function is a React component and not just a regular JavaScript function. This can improve code readability for some developers.
* *Aesthetics:* Some developers simply prefer the syntax `+const MyComponent: React.FC<MyProps> = (...)+` over the inline `+const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }: MyProps) => (...)+` style.
* *Type Safety for Component-Level Properties:* It still provides type-checking for properties like `displayName`.

*The Conclusion*

You are perfectly safe using `React.FC` in modern React and TypeScript projects. 
The historical reasons for avoiding it are no longer valid.

However, the simpler, non-`FC` approach of just typing the props object directly is also perfectly fine and is often preferred for its simplicity and minimalism. 
There is no longer a "wrong" way to do it; 
just choose a consistent style for your project.
