Turbopack is a next-generation bundler developed by the team at Vercel (the creators of Next.js). 
It’s designed to replace Webpack as the default bundler for Next.js apps, offering significantly improved speed during development, especially for larger projects. 
Built with Rust, Turbopack’s main goal is to optimize build times and enable better performance in development environments. [...]
Turbopack was introduced in Next.js 13.4, which was released in 2023.
