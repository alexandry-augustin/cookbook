If you create a custom `useBreakpoint` hook in React to programmatically handle Tailwind breakpoints, you **do need to define them manually** within your hook's logic. This is because **Tailwind's breakpoints are defined in CSS and aren't directly accessible in your React JavaScript code at runtime**.

*Why Manual Definition Is Necessary*

CSS vs. JavaScript:: Tailwind's utility classes (`md:`, `lg:`, etc.) work by generating CSS media queries. This logic is compiled into your final stylesheet. When your React component renders, it's a JavaScript process that doesn't have a built-in way to read those CSS values.
Decoupling:: Your React component needs to know the exact pixel values to compare against `window.innerWidth`. The custom hook serves as the bridge, translating a JavaScript-based window size to a conceptual Tailwind breakpoint name.

*How to Keep Breakpoints in Sync*

Manually defining the breakpoints in your hook can be a maintenance issue if you later customize your `tailwind.config.js`. To keep your definitions in sync, you have a few options:

Manual Syncing:: Simply copy the values from your `tailwind.config.js` into your hook. This is the most straightforward approach but requires you to remember to update it if you change the config.
Importing `tailwind.config.js`:: You can use a build tool like Vite or Webpack to import your `tailwind.config.js` file directly into your JavaScript. This allows you to reference the `theme.screens` object and avoid manual copying. However, this can sometimes increase your bundle size as it might include the entire Tailwind configuration. 
Third-Party Libraries:: A more robust solution is to use a library like `use-tailwind-breakpoint`. These libraries are designed to handle this exact problem, often providing helper functions to access your `tailwind.config.js` values safely and efficiently.
