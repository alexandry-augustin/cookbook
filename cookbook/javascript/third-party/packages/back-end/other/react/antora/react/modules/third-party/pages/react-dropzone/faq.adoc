== Replace Individual Image

____
> when using react-dropzone with image previews, is it possible to replace an image by clicking on it 

You can replace an image in React-Dropzone by clicking on it, but it's not a built-in feature. You'll need to **implement custom logic** to achieve this functionality.

*How to Implement It*

To make an image replaceable, you'll need to handle the click event on the image preview itself. This event should trigger the file input dialog again, allowing the user to select a new file. Here's a general approach:

1.Wrap the Image in a Clickable Component:: Render the image preview inside a `div` or similar element that has an `onClick` handler.
2.Access the File Input Programmatically:: React-Dropzone provides a `fileInputRef` or similar method to access the underlying file input element.
3.Trigger the Click:: Inside your `onClick` handler for the image, you'll call a function that programmatically triggers a click on the hidden file input element.

This custom logic essentially re-opens the file selection dialog when the user clicks on an existing image preview.

*Example Logic*

Here's a simplified conceptual outline of the code:

[,jsx]
----
import React, { useCallback, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';

function MyDropzone() {
  const fileInputRef = useRef(null);
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);

  const onDrop = useCallback(acceptedFiles => {
    // We only care about the first file for replacement
    setFile(acceptedFiles[0]);
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({ onDrop });

  const handleImageClick = () => {
    // Programmatically click the hidden file input
    fileInputRef.current.click();
  };

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()}>
      <input {...getInputProps()} ref={fileInputRef} />
      {file ? (
        <div onClick={handleImageClick} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
          <img src={URL.createObjectURL(file)} alt="preview" style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
          <p>Click to replace</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Drag and drop or click to upload</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
----

In this example, the `handleImageClick` function is what makes the magic happen. By calling `fileInputRef.current.click()`, you're telling the browser to open the file dialog just as if the user had clicked the dropzone area.

> in dropzone, i want to have each image preview to be replaceable by drag and drop individually, do I need mutliple dropzone 

No, you don't need multiple Dropzone instances to make each image preview individually replaceable by drag and drop.

*How to Achieve This*

You can achieve this functionality with a **single Dropzone instance** by using its API and events. The key is to handle the drag and drop events for the individual preview elements, not for the entire dropzone area.

1. Disable Dropzone's default behavior:: Initially, configure Dropzone to not handle file drops on the main element. This can be done by setting the `disable-element---drop` option (or a similar one, depending on the exact version/configuration) to the main dropzone container.
2. Add `draggable` attribute:: When an image is successfully uploaded and a preview is created, dynamically add the `draggable="true"` attribute to each individual preview element (`.dz-preview`).  This makes the preview elements themselves draggable.
3. Handle drag and drop events:: Use JavaScript to handle the `dragstart`, `dragenter`, `dragover`, and `drop` events on the preview elements.
* `dragstart`: Store the data of the dragged item (e.g., its ID or a reference to the DOM element).
* `dragover`: Prevent the default behavior to allow a drop. This is crucial for enabling the drop.
* `drop`: When an item is dropped on a preview element, get the data of both the dragged item and the drop target. Then, you can use the Dropzone API to:
** Remove the original file associated with the drop target preview.
** Add the new file (the one that was dragged) to the dropzone. You can use methods like `Dropzone.forElement().addFile(file)` to programmatically add the new file.

4. Listen for the `addedfile` event:: After a file is added to Dropzone (either via the main drop area or your custom logic), the `addedfile` event is fired. Use this event to generate the custom preview element with the `draggable` attribute and set up the drag and drop event listeners on it.

By implementing this, you'll have a single Dropzone instance that manages all the files, but the user will be able to replace individual images by dragging and dropping new files directly onto their previews.
