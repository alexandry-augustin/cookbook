= Actions

Actions are simply functions defined within your store that are responsible for modifying the state.

Here are the key characteristics and typical usage:

Functions that Update State:: An action is just a function that calls the `set` function provided to the store creator (`create`).
Encapsulation of Logic:: They typically contain the business logic for how the state should change (e.g., `increasePopulation`, `fetchData`). This keeps your state update logic centralized and separate from your components.
Colocated with State:: The recommended pattern in Zustand is to define the state properties and the action functions together within the object returned by the `create` callback.

Example of a Zustand Store with Actions:

[,javascript]
----
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useBearStore = create((set) => ({
  // State
  bears: 0,
  
  // Actions
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),

  // Asynchronous Action example
  fetchData: async (url) => {
    // Perform async logic (e.g., an API call)
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Update state when data is ready
    set({ fetchedData: data });
  },
}))
----

You then access these actions (like `increasePopulation`) in your components using the store hook, and call them to trigger state updates.
