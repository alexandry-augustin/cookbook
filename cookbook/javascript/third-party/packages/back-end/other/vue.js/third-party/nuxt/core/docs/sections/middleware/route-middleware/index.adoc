In web development, navigation guards allow you to control access to certain routes. These guards are especially useful for:

* Protecting routes that require authentication.
* Redirecting users based on their roles.
* Running specific logic before navigating to a page (like fetching data).

== Ordering

[,https://blog.logrocket.com/navigation-guards-nuxt-3-definenuxtroutemiddleware/]
____
On any given route, middleware executes in this order:

* Global middleware
* Middleware defined in the `middleware` array of `definePageMeta`, in the order of appearance

Global middleware executes in alphabetical order based on the filename, but if you need to run middleware in a specific order, you can prefix it with a number, like so: `middleware/01.isAdmin.global.js`.
