= Types


There are three types of route middlewares

== Inline Middleware

// * defined directly within the page

....
./
├── pages/
│   └── index.vue
├── ...
....

[,vue, title="pages/index.vue"]
----
<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: [
    function (to, from) {
      // ...
    },
    'my-middleware', // Optional
  ],
});
</script>
----

you can define multiple anonymous middleware on one page, and they’ll be executed in the order they appear in the middleware array.

== Named Middleware

* automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used on a page
// * placed in the `middleware/` 

....
./
├── middleware/
│   ├── ...
│   └── my-middleware.js
├── pages/
│   └── index.vue
├── ...
....

== Global Middleware

____
Writing global middleware works the same way as writing named middleware, with one difference: the name of the middleware file has to be suffixed with `.global`. 
So, the file will be named `middleware/isAdmin.global.js` instead of `middleware/isAdmin.js`, and then it'll run on every route, without needing to be specified in `definePageMeta`.
____

* executed before routing to *any* page
* executed in alphabetical order
// * placed in the `middleware/`
// * with suffix `.global`

____
Note that it's not possible to define exceptions for global middleware -- they always run on every route.
If you want the global middleware to skip over a certain route, you have to write the check inside the middleware itself.
