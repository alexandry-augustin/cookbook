____
route middlewares [...] allow you to perform operations before switching from one route to another. 
These route middlewares are commonly use to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing certain routes [navigation guards] or to perform cookie-based authentication checks.

____
In web development, navigation guards allow you to control access to certain routes. These guards are especially useful for:

* Protecting routes that require authentication.
* Redirecting users based on their roles.
* Running specific logic before navigating to a page (like fetching data).

> "Route middleware are navigation guards that receive the current route and the next route as arguments."

There are three types of route middlewares

== Inline Middleware

* defined directly within the page

....
./
├── pages/
│   └── index.vue
├── ...
....

[,vue, title="pages/index.vue"]
----
<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: [
    function (to, from) {
      // ...
    },
    'my-middleware',
  ],
});
</script>

[,vue, title="pages/index.vue"]
----
<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 
    function (to, from) {
      // ...
    },
});
</script>
----

== Named Middleware

* automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used on a page
* placed in the `middleware/` 

....
./
├── middleware/
│   ├── ...
│   └── name.js
├── pages/
│   └── index.vue
├── ...
....

[,vue,title="middleware/my-middleware.ts"]
----
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (to.params.id === '1') {
    return abortNavigation()
  }
  
  // Avoid infinite redirect loop
  if (to.path !== '/') {
    return navigateTo('/')
  }
})
----

[middlewares/my-middleware.ts]
----
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
    // If the user has no Administrator privileges, the user will be logged out, and will be redirect to the login page to login again. 
    if(isAdmin() === false) {
            logout();

        return navigateTo('/login')
    }

    // If the user has the rights, we do nothing, which implicitly means we redirect to the wished page.
})
----


== Global Middleware

* executed before routing to any page
* executed in alphabetical order
* placed in the `middleware/`
* with suffix `.global`
