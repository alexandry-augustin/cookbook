____
This module attempts to get you going with Nuxt + Ionic quickly, providing sane defaults for ionic and helpful components and utilities. 
The configuration file can still customize and override its default behaviors and provide full customisation of ionic.

* Ionic router integration: continue defining routes based on the structure of your `~/pages` directory and using page-level utilities such as `definePageMeta()`.
* Auto-imports: Ionic components, composables and icons are all https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports[auto-imported] for ease of use.
* Helpful components and utilities: This module provides components and utilities to accomplish common tasks more easily.
* Pre-render routes
* Mobile meta tags
* Capacitor integration: works out-of-the-box with https://capacitorjs.com/[Capacitor] for shipping to native platforms like iOS and Android.

== Installation

https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/get-started/installation[[docs\]]

[,bash]
----
pnpx nuxi@latest module add ionic
----

[,javascript,title="nuxt.config.ts"]
----
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/ionic'],
  ssr: false,
})
----

[,https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/get-started/installation]
____
If deploying to iOS or Android, be aware the app must be able to run completely client-side. 
We recommend setting `ssr: false` in your nuxt config. 
Find out more in https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/cookbook/web-and-device[deploying to both web and device].
____

Either remove your `app.vue` file or replace it with a https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/cookbook/customising-app-vue[custom one].

[,vue,title="app.vue"]
----
<template>
  <ion-app>
    <ion-router-outlet />
  </ion-app>
</template>
----

[,https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/cookbook/customising-app-vue]
____
`<ion-app>` is the container element of Ionic - there should be only one per project - and is required for certain behaviours to work. [...]

Equally, `<ion-router-outlet>` provides a mounting point for the route component. 
In regular Nuxt applications, this would be `<NuxtPage />`, but as Ionic Router is handling our routing we must use the `<ion-router-outlet>`.
____

[NOTE]
====
____
The first time you start a Nuxt project with `@nuxtjs/ionic` enabled, a `ionic.config.json` file will be created if it doesn't already exist.
____

== Watchouts

https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/get-started/watch-outs[[docs\]]

Use 
`<ion-router-outlet>`, `useIonRouter()` `router-link` property on any ion-component to change page
instead of
`<NuxtPage>`, `<NuxtLayout>`, `<NuxtLink>`.

The application code cannot contain any serverside rendering 
(https://ionic.nuxtjs.org/cookbook/web-and-device[Solutions for both web and device tagets].)
