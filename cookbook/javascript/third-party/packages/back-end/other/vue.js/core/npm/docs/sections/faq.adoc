____
[no] need to append `.value` when using the `ref` in the template. 
For convenience, `ref` 's are automatically unwrapped when used inside templates (with a few https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html#caveat-when-unwrapping-in-templates[caveats]).

____
Non-primitive values are turned into reactive proxies [by `ref`] via `reactive()`

* `ref()` takes the argument and returns it wrapped within a ref object with a `.value` property
* `ref()` is calling `reactive()` behind the scenes
* `reactive()` only takes objects, *NOT* JS primitives
* `ref()` has a `.value` property for reassigning, `reactive()` does not have this and therefore CANNOT be reassigned
