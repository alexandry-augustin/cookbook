The code inside is compiled as the content of the component's `setup()` function. 
This means that unlike normal `<script>`, which only executes once when the component is first imported, code inside `<script setup>` will **execute every time an instance of the component is created**.

____
any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template

NOTE: Reactive state needs to be explicitly created using `ref()`.
