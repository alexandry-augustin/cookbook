____
Nuxt needs Node to compile, but once compiled you only need Node if your site uses SSR or server routes

Use `nuxt build` with `ssr: false` for SPA, or `nuxt generate` for SSG.

== Installation

[,bash]
----
pnpx nuxi@latest init PROJECT_NAME

IMPORTANT: Will fail using fish shell -> use bash.

== Usage

Development Server: 

[,bash]
----
pnpm run dev
----

Build the application for production:

[,bash]
----
pnpm build
----

NOTE: Will create the `./dist/` directory.

Locally preview production build:

[,bash]
----
pnpm preview
----

Pre-renders every route of the application and stores the result in plain HTML files.

[,bash]
----
pnpx nuxi generate [ROOTDIR] [--cwd=<directory>] [--logLevel=<silent|info|verbose>] [--preset] [--dotenv] [--envName]

== Naming Conventions

[,https://zean.be/articles/vue-nuxtjs/]
____
The https://nuxtjs.org/[nuxtjs.org] website itself is a NuxtJS project and its source code can be found https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org[here]. 
Some conventions that I have observed and are following are:

* use kebab-case for everything in the `pages` folder
* use kebab-case for folders under the `components` folder but use PascalCase for all component names
* use kebab-case everywhere else
