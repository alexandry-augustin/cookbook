Nuxt and Quasar aren't really designed for the same use cases. 
Nuxt is more appropriate for projects that are more "website" than "webapp" like Quasar is.

You could use Nuxt to build an app, but you'll be fighting some of the design decisions of Nuxt in the process, and have to roll a lot of your own solutions to flesh out Nuxt into an application framework. 
It sounds like that's kind of what you were running into.
