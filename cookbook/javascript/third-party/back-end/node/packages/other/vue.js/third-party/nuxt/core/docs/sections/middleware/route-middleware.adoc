= Route Middleware

____
route middlewares [...] allow you to perform operations before switching from one route to another. 
These route middlewares are commonly use to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing certain routes [navigation guards] or to perform cookie-based authentication checks.

____
In web development, navigation guards allow you to control access to certain routes. These guards are especially useful for:

* Protecting routes that require authentication.
* Redirecting users based on their roles.
* Running specific logic before navigating to a page (like fetching data).

> "Route middleware are navigation guards that receive the current route and the next route as arguments."

== Types

There are three types of route middlewares:

Global middleware:: 
* executed before routing to any page
* executed in alphabetical order
* placed in the `middleware/`
* with suffix `.global`
Named middleware:: 
* automatically loaded via asynchronous import when used on a page
* placed in the `middleware/` 
Inline middleware:: 
* defined directly within the page
