= `useQuery`

[source,javascript]
----
const result = useQuery({ param1, param2, ... })
----

== Parameters

`queryKey`:: {empty}
`queryFn`:: {empty}
`select`:: {empty}
`keepPreviousData`:: {empty}

== Return Properties

The `result` object contains the following: 

`isPreviousData`:: {empty}

`isLoading`:: (bool) Same as `status === 'loading'`.

`isError`:: (bool) Same as `status === 'error'`.

`isSuccess`:: (bool) Same as `status === 'success'`.

`status`:: (string) Gives information about the data: Do we have any or not?
`'loading'`::: {empty}
`'error'`::: {empty}
`'success'`::: {empty}

`fetchStatus`:: (string) Gives information about the `queryFn`: Is it running or not?
`'fetching'`::: The query is currently fetching.
`'paused'`::: The query wanted to fetch, but it is paused. See https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/vue/guides/network-mode[Network Mode] guide.
`'idle'`::: The query is not doing anything at the moment.

`data`:: (object) {empty}

`error`:: (object) {empty}

== States

A query can only be in one of the following states at any given moment:

Loading:: The query has no data yet.
Error:: The query encountered an error and the error is available via the `error` property.
Success:: The query was successful and the data is available via the `data` property.

A query in Success status will usually have fetchStatus set to `idle`, but it could also be in `fetching` if a background refetch is happening.

A query that mounts and has no data will usually be in Loading status and have fetchStatus set to `fetching`, but it could also be `paused` if there is no network connection.

A query can be in Loading state without actually fetching data.
