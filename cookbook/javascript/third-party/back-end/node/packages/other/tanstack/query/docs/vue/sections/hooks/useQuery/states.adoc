= States

== Query States 

A query can only be in one of the following states at any given moment:

NOTE: A query that mounts and has no data will usually be in `loading` status and have `fetchStatus` set to `fetching`, but it could also be `paused` if there is no network connection.

=== `loading`

The query has no data yet.

NOTE: A query can be in `loading` state without actually fetching data.

=== `error`

The query encountered an error.

NOTE: The error is available via the `error` property.

=== `success`

The query was successful.

NOTE: The data is available via the `data` property.

NOTE: A query in `success` status will usually have `fetchStatus` set to `idle`, but it could also be in `fetching` if a background refetch is happening.

== Fetch States

=== `fetching`

The query is currently fetching.

=== `paused`

The query wanted to fetch, but it is paused. 

NOTE: See https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/vue/guides/network-mode[Network Mode] guide.

=== `idle`

The query is not doing anything at the moment.
