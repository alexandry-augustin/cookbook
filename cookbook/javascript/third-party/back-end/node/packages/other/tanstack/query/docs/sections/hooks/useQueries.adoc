____
The `useQueries` hook returns an array with all the query results. 
The order returned is the same as the input order.
____

== Parameters

`queries`:: array of query option objects identical to the `useQuery` hook (excluding the `queryClient` option because it can be passed in on the top level).
`combine`:: combine `data` (or other Query information) from the results into a single value.
