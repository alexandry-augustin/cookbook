Vue: Vapor Mode

Vue is considered a framework. It includes an entire suite of tools, such as routers, state management, testing suites, and everything you need to build a complete web app. [These features are very similar to what Angular provides.] However, these tools are compartmentalized and you can strip Vue down to simply being the core library [, similar to React].
