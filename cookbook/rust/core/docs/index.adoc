The question of whether Rust is "more difficult" than C++ is complex, with different interpretations and experiences. [...]
C++ is a much older and larger language with decades of evolution, resulting in many features, paradigms, and historical baggage. 
Rust is a newer language, designed with modern principles, and is generally more concise and consistent.
