Primary Use:: Excellent for 2D game development, emulators, and multimedia applications.  
Abstraction Level:: Provides a simple abstraction layer over underlying operating system graphics and input APIs.
Key Feature:: It can be used to set up the necessary window and context for rendering with more powerful, low-level APIs like OpenGL or Vulkan. It's used in many popular games.
