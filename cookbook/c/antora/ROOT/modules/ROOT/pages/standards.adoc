**ANSI C** (C89) and **ISO C (C89/C90)** refer to essentially the **same standard** for the C programming language.

*Origins and Naming*

* **ANSI C (C89):** The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published the first official standard for C in **1989**, designated as ANSI X3.159-1989. This is why it is often called **C89** or "ANSI C."
* **ISO C (C90):** The following year, the standard was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and published as **ISO/IEC 9899:1990**. This version is referred to as **C90**.

The ISO/IEC C90 standard had only minor editorial changes from the ANSI C89 standard. Therefore, **C89** and **C90** (and colloquially, "ANSI C") describe the **identical language specification**.

Since the adoption of this first standard, ISO/IEC has taken the lead in developing and publishing subsequent revisions (like C99, C11, C17/C18, and C23), which ANSI generally adopts. However, the term "ANSI C" is still widely used to refer to this original 1989/1990 version.
