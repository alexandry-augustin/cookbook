The classic book **"The C Programming Language"** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (often affectionately called **K&R**) has been published in **two** major editions:

First Edition (1978)::
* This edition documented the C language *before* it was officially standardized.
* It served as the **de facto standard** for what is known as **K&R C** or **C78**.

Second Edition (1988)::
* This edition was published to cover the changes resulting from the **ANSI C standard** (C89/C90).
* It describes C as defined by the ANSI standard.
* As of the current date (2025), the Second Edition is still the **most recent** major edition of the book. No subsequent edition has been released to cover C99, C11, C17, or C23.

So, while there have been many printings, translations, and formats (hardcover, paperback, eBook) published over the years, there are **two core, distinct editions** that reflect different versions of the C language.
