> "POSIX defines both the system- and user-level application programming interfaces (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating systems."

In general the GNU C library supports the ISO C and POSIX standards.

== System Calls

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call

A system call does not require a context switch to another process, it is processed in the context of whichever process invoked it.

popular system calls:

* `open`
* `read`
* `write`
* `close`
* `wait`
* `execve`
* `fork`
* `exit`
* `kill`

System calls can be roughly grouped into five major categories:

* Process Control
** load
** execute
** create process (for example, fork on Unix-like systems or NtCreateProcess in the Windows NT Native API)
** terminate process
** get/set process attributes
** wait for time, wait event, signal event
** allocate, free memory
* File management
** create file, delete file
** open, close
** read, write, reposition
** get/set file attributes
* Device Management
** request device, release device
** read, write, reposition
** get/set device attributes
** logically attach or detach devices
* Information Maintenance
** get/set time or date
** get/set system data
** get/set process, file, or device attributes
* Communication
** create, delete communication connection
** send, receive messages
** transfer status information
** attach or detach remote devices
